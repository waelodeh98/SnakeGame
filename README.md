🐍 Snake Game (C++ Console)

A console-based Snake Game developed in C++ with colorful terminal output, sound effects, and multiple difficulty levels.
The game runs on Windows and provides an interactive console experience.

✨ Features

🟢 Multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard

🎨 Colored console interface using ANSI escape codes

🔊 Sound effects for eating fruits and losing (Windows PlaySound)

🔢 Dynamic snake tail movement

🕹️ Real-time input using keyboard (w, a, s, d)

🏆 Score tracking and automatic game over detection

🔄 Option to play again without restarting the program

🕹️ Gameplay

The game starts with a main menu to choose the difficulty level.

Snake starts at the center of the map.

Player moves the snake using keys:

w → Up

s → Down

a → Left

d → Right

Eat fruits ($) to increase score and grow the tail.

Hitting walls or the snake tail ends the game.

After losing, you can choose to play again.

🎯 Controls

w, a, s, d → Move the snake

x → Exit the game

Y / N → Play again or exit

🛠️ Technologies Used

📌 Notes

This project is designed for learning C++ fundamentals and practicing console application development.

Sound effects work only on Windows OS.

Difficulty levels control the speed of the snake (Lower value = faster movement).
